As an energy-efficient hardware solution, machine learning accelerators for deep Convolutional NNs or traditional ANNs are also gaining popularity in the area of embedded vision, robotics and cyberphysics. However, the design parameters of NN models vary significantly from application to application. Hence, it’s hard to provide one general and highly-efficient hardware solution to accommodate all of them, and it is also impractical for the domain-specific developers to customize their own hardware targeting on a specific NN model. To deal with this dilemma, this study proposes a design automation tool, DeepBurning, allowing the application/algorithm developers to build from scratch learning accelerators that targets their specific NN models with custom configurations and optimized performance. DeepBurning includes a RTL-level accelerator generator and a coordinated compiler that generates the control flow and data layout under the user-specified constraints. The results can be used to implement CNN processor chip or help generate FPGA-based NN accelerators. In general, DeepBurning supports a large family of NN models including CNNs, RNNs to ANNs, and greatly simplifies the design flow of NN accelerators for the machine learning or AI application developers. The generated learning accelerators evaluated with our FPGA board or chip-scale simulation exhibit great power efficiency compared to state-of-the-art manually optimized solutions.</p> <p>Design Flow of Chip Generator with DeepBurning:</p> <p><img src="/projects/deepburning.jpg" alt="DeepBuring"></p> <p>[<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7544251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>]</p></div></div> <div class="md-card show-border"><!----> <div class="card-content"><h3 id="taming-the-diversity-of-convolutional-neural-network-topology">Taming the diversity of Convolutional Neural Network topology</h3> <p><strong>An adaptive data folding and parallelization scheme for deep learning accelerators</strong></p> <p>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated excellent performance in machine vision and recognition area, and sparked a hot trend of research and study on both deep learning algorithms and hardware. Especially, various hardware accelerators have been proposed to support deep CNN based applications, which are known to be both compute-and-memory intensive. Although the most advanced CNN accelerators can deliver high computational throughput, the performance is highly unstable. Once changed to accommodate a new network with different parameters like layers and kernel size, the fixed hardware structure, may no longer well match the data flows. Consequently, the accelerator will fail to deliver high performance due to the underutilization of either logic resource or memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we proposed a general deep CNN parallelization scheme based on deep learning accelerators, which offers multiple types of data-level parallelism: inter-kernel, intra-kernel and hybrid. Our design can adaptively switch among the three types of parallelism and the corresponding data tiling schemes to dynamically match different networks or even different layers of a single network. No matter how we change the hardware configurations or network types, the proposed network mapping strategy ensures the optimal performance and energy efficiency. The evaluation shows that, for some layers of the well=known large scale CNNs, it is possible to achieve a speedup of 4.0x- 8.3x over previous state-of-the-art NN accelerator. For the whole phase of network forward-propagation, our design achieves 28.04% PE energy saving, 90.3% on-chip memory energy saving over the prior solutions on average.</p> <p><img src="/projects/c-brain.jpg" alt="DeepBuring"></p> <p>[DAC16][<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7544365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>]</p></div></div> <div class="md-card show-border"><!----> <div class="card-content"><p><strong>Scaling down the machine learning architecture for lightweight devices demanding mobile or always-on intellegence</strong></p> <p>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are making substantial progress in computer vision, image processing, speech recognition and other Recognition, Mining and Synthesis (RMS) applications.
